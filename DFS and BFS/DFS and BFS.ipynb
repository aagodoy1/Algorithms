    "In this Jupyter notebook, we are going to solve some problems using DFS and BFS, which are search algorithms. If you are not familiar with these concepts, I recommend checking out the theory first. However, I can give you a general idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a tree, and you want to find a specific leaf. You have two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BFS (Breadth-First Search): You start by looking at all the leaves closest to the tree trunk. If you don't find it among the closest ones, you move to the \"second level\" and check all the next closest leaves. Repeat this process until you find the leaf you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DFS (Depth-First Search): You pick one branch of the tree and explore it deeply until you reach the end. This means you start with a leaf closest to the trunk (level 1) and, if it's not the one youâ€™re looking for, you continue to the next leaf on the same branch, moving to level 2 in proximity to the trunk. If you reach the end of the branch without finding your leaf, you backtrack to the previous level and continue to the next leaf.\n",
